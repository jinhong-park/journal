<blockquote>

  <p>Roosters make noise in the morning as a way to establish and maintain their territory, as well as to signal to other roosters that they are awake and alert. This behavior is driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including the rooster’s circadian rhythm and the presence of other roosters in the area. The exact genetic mechanisms underlying this behavior are not well understood, but they are thought to involve the regulation of certain hormones and neurotransmitters in the brain.</p>
